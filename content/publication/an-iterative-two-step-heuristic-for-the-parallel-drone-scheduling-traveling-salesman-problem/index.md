abstract: "A recent evolution in urban logistics involves the usage of drones.
  In this article, we address a heuristic solution of the parallel drone
  scheduling traveling salesman problem, recently introduced by Murray and Chu.
  In this problem, deliveries are split between a vehicle and drones. The
  vehicle performs a classical delivery tour, while the drones are constrained
  to perform back and forth trips. The objective is to minimize completion time.
  We propose an iterative two-step heuristic, composed of: a coding step that
  transforms a solution into a customer sequence, and a decoding step that
  decomposes the customer sequence into a tour for the vehicle and trips for the
  drones. Decoding is expressed as a bicriteria shortest path problem and is
  carried out by dynamic programming. Experiments conducted on benchmark
  instances confirm the efficiency of the approach and give some insights on
  this drone delivery system."
